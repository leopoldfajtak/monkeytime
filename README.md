## The Game
You are terribly bored and not allowed/not in the mood to leave the house? You and your friends are up for a fun and custom-made challenge? Then Monkey Time© is just right for you, crazy monkeys!

### Goal
The goal of the game is to guess as many words as possible.

### Preparations
First of all, everyone thinks of and writes down (number-number) words. Think of terms which you imagine would be fun to explain, mime or guess by sound. Depending on your preference and the age of all players you can choose words of varying difficulty, promiscuity, level of disgust etc.. Of course you should be pretty certain all players know the words.

### How to play
One round consists of 4 levels. 

#### LEVEL 1: Explain.
Explain the term as well as possible.
* No synonyms (no “another word for…”)
* No rhymes (no “it rhymes with…”)
* Do not use words from the same word stem. (e.g. theft-thief)

#### LEVEL 2: Mime.
Use your body and face to depict the term.
* Do not make sounds.
* No sign language.
* Showing numbers using your fingers is okay.
* Do not use items. Only you, yourself and… well… you.

#### LEVEL 3: Explain using one word.
**One** word.
* see level 1

#### LEVEL 4: Sound.
Make **one** sound to describe the word.
* You may repeat the sound in a slightly different way but it must clearly be the same sound.

The words remain the same throughout one round (aka all four levels ). You have one minute per level to guess as many words as possible, each term equals one point. 
Monkey Time©  can either be played in teams or individually. If you play in teams, each team gets one minute per level to guess. If you play individually everyone gets to guess for one minute while one person explains/mimes/makes a sound.
However, you can also play for fun, without counting points.

(If this game seems familiar to you it is just a glitch in the matrix.)

## Variants

### Drunk Monkeys
You are throwing a crazy party with your monkey buddies? Might as well use this game to get super wasted. In this case you play individually. Each level everyone summates all their won points and multiplies them with the number of the respective level. This is the number of shots/slurps you get to distribute among the other players (or you can drink them yourself, you little maso-monkey). 

Non-drinking monkeys can join the fun and answer an embarrassing question instead for example.

### Strip Monkeys
Whoever guesses the term gets to either put a piece of clothing back on (unless they have not taken off anything yet) or tell someone else to take off on piece of clothing.
Once there are no more words, a new level begins. (But the clothing stays off until the round ends, you dirty little monkeys.)

If someone refuses to take off more clothing, they can answer an embarrassing question instead for example.
